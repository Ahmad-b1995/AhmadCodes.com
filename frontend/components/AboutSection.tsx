            I started my journey as a front-end developer in 2016, building
            engaging web applications using React.js, Angular, and Next.js. Over
            the years, I&apos;ve honed my skills in building scalable, maintainable
            solutions with a strong focus on performance, user experience, and
            code quality. In 2021, I transitioned into full-stack development,
            expanding my expertise to include back-end technologies like NestJS.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Currently, I am focused on developing my own crypto generator
            service, where I leverage the full development stack â€” from planning
            and design to the final product. My work revolves around building
            robust applications using modern technologies such as NestJS,
            Next.js, with a strong passion for optimizing every step of the
            development process.

          <p className="mb-4">
            As a Linux enthusiast, I rely on terminal commands and automation to
            streamline my workflow. I firmly believe in the power of efficient
            development environments and practices, using tools like Docker and
            various testing libraries to ensure top-notch code quality.
          </p>

            Outside of coding, I am an avid reader. Whether it&apos;s diving into new
            programming concepts, staying updated with the latest technology
            trends, or exploring a wide variety of subjects like business,
            personal growth, and health and fitness, reading is an integral part
            of my life.
